Download
========

Icons are available to download directly from this repository.


Install
========

### Icons

* Move the folder(s) *Luv* `/usr/share/icons` for all environments or `~/.icons` for GTK based environments or `~/.local/share/icons` for Plasma 5.
* And finally select the theme in the Settings.


Reporting missing icons
========

When reporting missing icons make sure to follow these steps so we can resolve it faster:

### For Linux:

1. Add **screenshots** of the missing icon and the instances where it's displayed like: menus, taskbars, panels, notifications, etc.
2. Use the following title prefix (without the quotes): "[Linux] App_name Desktop_environment" - that way we can tag them appropriately.
3. Add the relevant launcher information, software uses files with the extension *.desktop* as launchers for menus like Kickoff, Kicker, Mint menu, Gnome Shell overview, Unity dash, Whisker menu, etc. and these launchers are stored in `/usr/share/applications` (there might be a */kde* or */kde4* folder for KDE apps) for software installed through a package or the package manager. User-installed binaries and Google Chrome apps install their launchers here: `/home/$USER/.local/share/applications/`. Simply open these `.desktop` files with any text editor; copy and paste the line that says `Icon=` to your issue.
4. Add a description of the software, it's very important for us to know what the software does.

Some software uses absolute paths in their launchers, as such even when we add the icon the system will not load it, you may use [Hardcoded Icon Fixer](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer) to resolve this problem.
